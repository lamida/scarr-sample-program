# ScaRR Sample Program

In this folder we are generating different analyser viewer provided by LLVM. See gen-dot.sh to see how the graph is generated. 

In LLVM legacy opt, we are using the following arguments to trigger some visualization of the program.

* --dot-callgraph         - Print call graph to 'dot' file
* --dot-cfg               - Print CFG of function to 'dot' file
* --dot-cfg-only          - Print CFG of function to 'dot' file (with no function bodies)
* --dot-dom               - Print dominance tree of function to 'dot' file
* --dot-dom-only          - Print dominance tree of function to 'dot' file (with no function bodies)
* --dot-postdom           - Print postdominance tree of function to 'dot' file
* --dot-postdom-only      - Print postdominance tree of function to 'dot' file (with no function bodies)
* --dot-regions           - Print regions of function to 'dot' file
* --dot-regions-only      - Print regions of function to 'dot' file (with no function bodies)

Need graphviz. Install using:
```
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

## Generating dot* Output

To generate dot graph output, use `./gen.sh` script. The script accept the c source filename (without .c extension). After 
the script run, it will create a folder with the name and subfolders with all the analyser above executed.

## ScaRR

We are creating a simple LLVM pass that will put the information about checkpoint and LoA in the CFG.
